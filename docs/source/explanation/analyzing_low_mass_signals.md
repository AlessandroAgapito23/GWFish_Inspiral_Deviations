# Analyzing quasi-monochromatic signals

This tutorial details how to approach the simulation of signals 
for low mass binaries, such as those that contain white dwarfs.

The waveforms for these are typically estimated as regular CBC ones,
truncated at high frequency. 
This is achieved within GWFish by using the parameter 
`max_frequency_cutoff`.
