# Parameter definitions and units

The parameters used to describe a CBC within `GWFish` are as follows:

- `'mass_1'`: the mass of the primary object, in solar masses $M_{\odot}$;
- `'mass_2'`: the mass of the secondary object, in solar masses $M_{\odot}$;
- `'redshift'`: the redshift of the merger;
- `'luminosity_distance'`: the luminosity distance of the merger, in Megaparsecs;
- `'theta_jn'`: the inclination angle (between the observation direction 
    and the angular momentum of the merger), in radians;
- `'psi'`: the polarization angle of the merger, in radians;
- `'phase'`: the initial phase of the waveform, in radians;
- `'ra'`: the right ascension of the merger, in radians;
- `'dec'`: the declination of the merger, in radians;
- `'geocent_time'`: the time of merger, expressed as [GPS time](https://www.andrews.edu/~tzs/timeconv/timeconvert.php?);
- `'max_frequency'`: a maximum frequency at which to cut off the waveform, in Hz.
