# Glossary

A glossary of common terms and abbreviations used in gravitational wave data analysis.
Also checkout the one from the [emfollow](https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/userguide/glossary.html) documentation from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration.

BBH
    Binary Black Hole: the coalescence of two black holes.

BNS
    Binary Neutron Star: the coalescence of two neutron stars.

CBC
    Compact Binary Coalescence: the coalescence of two compact objects, such as black holes or neutron stars.

SNR
    Signal-to-Noise Ratio: a simple way to quantify the significance of a signal; for a real signal, in terms of the Wiener product it will look like $\text{SNR} = \sqrt{(h | d)}$ where $d$ are the measured data while $h$ is the signal template. The "optimal SNR" we use to approximate the real one (since we do not know the noise realization $n$ in $d = h + n$) is $\text{SNR}_{\text{opt}} = \sqrt{(h | h)}$.
